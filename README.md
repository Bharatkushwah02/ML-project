# 📊 Loan Interest Rate Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses historical loan data to build a Machine Learning model that can predict the **interest rate** of a loan based on key financial features. The model is developed using Python and Linear Regression (OLS).

---

## 🚀 Objective

To develop a predictive model that helps financial institutions estimate suitable interest rates for loan applicants using historical data, improving decision-making and reducing loan risk.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- **Model Used**: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression
- **Target Variable**: Interest Rate (ln_rate)
- **Accuracy Achieved**: **96.5% (R² Score)**

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes the following important features:

- `Amount_Requested`
- `Debt_To_Income_Ratio`
- `Inquiries_in_the_Last_6_Months`
- `Open_CREDIT_Lines`
- `Employment_Length`
- `FICO_Range`
- `Loan_Purpose`
- `Home_Ownership`
- `States`
- `Monthly_Income`
